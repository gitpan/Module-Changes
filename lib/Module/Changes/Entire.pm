=head1 NAME

Module::Changes::Entire - an entire Changes file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Module::Changes;
    my $changes = Module::Changes->make_object_for_type('entire');
    print $changes->newest_release->version;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents an entire Changes file.

See Module::Changes for the definition of the terms I<revision>, I<version>,
I<subversion> and I<alpha>.

=head1 METHODS

This class inherits all methods from L<Module::Changes::Base>.

=over 4

=item name

    $changes->name('Foo-Bar');
    my $name = $changes->name;

Set or get the overall distribution name of the Changes file.

=item releases

    $changes->releases_unshift($release);
    for my $release ($changes->releases) { ... }

This is an array accessor giving access to all the releases contained in the
Changes file. See L<Class::Accessor::Complex>'s C<mk_array_accessors()> for
which methods are available.

=item newest_release

    print $changes->newest_release->version;

Returns the most recent release object.

=item add_empty_release

    $changes->add_empty_release(sub { my $release = shift; ...  });

Adds a release object. Its version number is taken from the previously most
recent release. Its author is also taken from the the previous release.

Takes a coderef argument. The empty release object is passed to the coderef
before adding it to the list of releases. The coderef might manipulate the
version number, for example.

=item add_new_revision

    $changes->add_new_revision;

Add a new release. Its version number is taken from the previously most recent
release, increased to the next revision. Its author is also taken from the the
previous release.

For example, if the previous release was version C<v0.02>, the new release
will be version C<v1.00>.

=item add_new_version

    $changes->add_new_version;

Add a new release. Its version number is taken from the previous release,
increased to the next version. Its author is also taken from the the
previous release. 

For example, if the previous release was version C<v0.02>, the new release
will be version C<v0.03>. If it was C<v0.02_01>, it will still be C<v0.03>.

=item add_new_subversion

    $changes->add_new_subversion;

Add a new release. Its version number is taken from the previous release,
increased to the next subversion. Its author is also taken from the the
previous release.

For example, if the previous release was version C<v0.02>, the new release
will be version C<v0.02.01>.

=item add_new_alpha

    $changes->add_new_alpha;

Add a new release. Its version number is taken from the previous release,
increased to the next alpha. Its author is also taken from the the
previous release.

For example, if the previous release was version C<v0.02>, the new release
will be version C<v0.02_01>.
